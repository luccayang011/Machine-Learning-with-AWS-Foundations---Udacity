The model still needs more training. There are only 9 iterations, and the graphs are still going up.
We see the evaluation completion percentage has just reached 100%, which is a good sign but isnâ€™t fully consistent yet.
The training completion graph is still going up. The reward function and model are revealing good signs, but need more training time.


Once the evaluation percentage completion reached 100% a bit ago, and the training percentage reached 100% roughly ~ 100 iterations ago, 
the model is well trained. Continue training might lead to overfitting.

We can also consider tune the hyperparameter(learning rate) to control the training performance.
